\chapter{Introduction}
\label{introduction}


Artworks are sensitive to many external factors, such as humidity, temperature, and vibrations.
While these factors are generally well controlled in museums and storage, art pieces also need to be moved between these buildings.
Artworks include a variety of objects, ranging from photographs and paintings to the pieces needed for modern installations.
The transportation, therefore, needs to be secure and flexible.
Sensors play a critical role in the safe transportation of these objects.


\section{Motivation}

Certify is an international cooperative project between twelve partners in Switzerland and the EU %\citep{Brüschre von certify}.
One of those partners is the University of Zurich.
Its focus is on the development of Internet of Things (IoT) systems for security, monitoring, and detection %\citep{Brüschüre von certify}.
Next to certifications and the development of frameworks, Certify also concerns itself with the integration of IoT devices.


One of the multiple currently running pilots of Certify is the "Tracking and monitoring of artworks" %\citep{https://certify-project.eu/pilots/}.
The goal of this pilot is to enable the constant tracking and monitoring of artwork by attaching a device to it.
This device allows for unique identification using cryptographic methods.
It is also intended to act as a cluster of sensors that collect information about the artwork's surroundings that is relevant to the well-being of the artwork.
The goal is to have constant data on the artwork throughout its lifecycle.
This is intended to help secure the artwork and help with chain of custody monitoring.



\section{Thesis Goals}

This project aims to develop a system that implements a localized version of the artwork tracking envisioned by the Certify project, meant for transportation in a truck.
Additionally, the system will extend the Certify Projects goal by adding new detection methods and informing the truck driver about potential problems.

The goal is to develop a system that tracks the state of artwork in a truck using different detection methods.
The devices attached to the artworks, called tags, build a local decentralized network.
The driver's phone can query the network and display the collected metrics to them.
The system should alert the driver if a metric is outside the accepted norm.

This Thesis presents a proof of concept implementation.
The used metrics are not intended to be a complete representation of the sensors needed for security transport art.
Rather, they are intended to show different types of sensors that can be used.
This Thesis assumes that the data transfer to a server using 4G, as planned by the Certify project, will work and will not be implemented in this Thesis.



\section{Methodology}

This Thesis was made in four stages:

\subsubsection{Reserach}
In a first step, the basis of the Thesis had to be researched.
This involved familiarizing with existing research on artwork tracking, local IoT networks, and commonly used communication protocols.
Existing artwork tracking methods need to be analyzed and evaluated, considering their strength and shortcomings during transportation in a truck.
The types of sensors that could be relevant need to be chosen based on existing research, cost, and availability.
Options for the network architecture inside the truck needed to be researched and compared based on performance, stability, and security.
A communication protocol needed to be chosen based on the same criteria.

\subsubsection{Design}
Once the fundamental knowledge for the project had been acquired, the system had to be designed.
The design was chosen based on feasibility, security, and stability.

\subsubsection{Implementation}
The design was then implemented in a simplified manner based on the available material.
For this, four tags were built and equipped with sensors, communication capabilities, and a power supply.
Then, the required software was written, using existing implementations when possible and writing new code when required.
A simple example app was also developed, based on an existing communications app published by Nordic Semiconductors and installed on a phone.

\subsubsection{Evaluation}
The developed system of tags and phone was tested in a series of five experiments.
The first four experiments were intended to capture a specific part of the system, while the last was a general-purpose test.
The tests were performed in a manner that ensured minimal external influence.
The resulting data from the tests were analyzed using statistical methods.
The goal was to determine the system's reliability, find limitations, and look for improvements.

\section{Thesis Outline}

This Thesis is structured as follows:

Chapter Two presents the fundamental knowledge researched for this Thesis. 
Chapter Two also presents previous research on tracking artwork and sensor networks.
Chapter Three presents the design of the system and its inner workings and capabilities.
Chapter Four shows the implementation that was developed and used for this project.
Chapter Five describes the experiments performed. It presents the results of the experiments and discusses them.
Chapter Six summarizes the findings of this Thesis and discusses the most important aspects in a conclusion.
